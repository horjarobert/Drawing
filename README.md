# 1.Intro #

-In this app you will be able to draw your own ideas, in a sample environment, where you can choose the RGB color (Red, Green, Blue), to be combined by your desire.  
-This app can be compiled to an Android device, just like a normal app builded in Android Studio (see that it has AndroidManifest.xml file inside the project)  
***

# 2.Description #

-This is a small project, not too complicated, where I used 2 basic Processing function (setup and draw);   
-More interesting is when you hover the <em>Clear</em> word, the screen will be cleared and it will capture the screen, it will save into your current document, few frames of the previous screen (your drawings...).  
***

# 3.Conclusion #

-I found Processing language very interesting when you want to build some graphic or just for fun if you want to know a drop from another programming language, and this project, was a good deep breath.
